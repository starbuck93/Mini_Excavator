This fork is to replace the PS3 controller library with the bluepad32 library. I am omitting the ESPServo library because I don't know how to integrate it into the bluepad32 board in the Arduino IDE. I'm not using any servos so this does not really affect me. If you're now reading this, this is a WIP! I have only integrated pivot and the two tracks into the controller, but I'm working on building the rest of the excavator to test the boom.
